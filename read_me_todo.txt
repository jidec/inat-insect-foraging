start.R contains code to import the data and use functions plotForagingTimeHists & plotForagingTimeRasters to make preliminary plots with specific ant species & seasons
color_foraging.R contains code to get started importing and using the species color data 

data folder contains files usa_ants.csv (all USA ant iNat observations) & ant_species_colors (a table of ant species color data), src folder contains functions\

Todo
	add function to get covariance of foraging times with human observer baseline, including sampling random non-ant inat data
    	add functionality to add lat long bounding box for plotForagingTimeHists
    	think about ways to analyze the foraging time data like avg hour, hour mode, foraging bout i.e. morning noon afternoon evening
   	 anything else I forgot about - please feel free to add ideas to the todo
